Adds an option to the UI tab in Game Options where you can choose a style to overload the "Combined Big" tactical overlay and target cursor used in the "Modern" graphic mode with those used in the "ASCII" graphic mode. The default option is "Thick", which is a properly scaled and more consistent alternative to the official ASCII borders. The "Thick" and "Thin" styles were contributed by rexorcorum.

I just like how it looks :)
